This file contains OGG audio files **not** following the recommended standard (31kHz sample rate and thus allowing higher audio frequencies).
**Attention - the HQ audio file do not follow the recommended OGG codec settings and might have a harmful impact on your device's performance!**
The HQ version is working on a Dreame X40, but not on a Dreame D10S Pro. That indicates that only more decent hardware variants support the higher sample rate.
